## 🔌 API Integration

The app supports loading tasks from an external JSON API. To use it, configure the endpoint in `App.jsx`:

```js
const response = await fetch("https://your-api-url.com/tasks");
```

The API response should follow this format:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Task title",
    "description": "Task description"
  }
]
```

## 💾 LocalStorage

Tasks added by the user are automatically saved to the browser's LocalStorage under the key `tasks`. This means your task list will persist between sessions without any backend.
